Overview
LexTerra is a law-tech platform dedicated to strengthening the legal security of land and real estate assets. It provides a digital, legal-grade safeguard that ensures no property transaction proceeds without the verified consent of the rightful owner.
The Problem
Land fraud, impersonation, fake registrations, and unauthorised sales remain pervasive in India and many emerging markets. Existing systems are largely reactive, forcing owners into lengthy disputes instead of preventing wrongful transactions at the source.
The Solution
LexTerra enables property owners to “lock” their assets through secure OTP and biometric verification, creating an additional, owner-controlled layer of authorisation. Registrations and transfers can be designed to check this lock, so only the authenticated owner can permit a transaction to move forward.
How It Works
Owners upload and validate their property documents on the platform, establishing a verified link between the person and the title.
A property lock is activated, which can only be released by the verified owner through prescribed legal-tech workflows (OTP, biometrics, and structured consent).
Through APIs, registries, and civic platforms, can integrate LexTerra to automatically verify lock status before processing any property-related action.
Target Users and Stakeholders
Individual citizens and NRIs seeking robust protection against impersonation, title theft, and fraudulent conveyances.
Governments, registries, and civic bodies are looking to embed preventive security into their registration infrastructure.
Financial institutions, enterprises, and professional advisors require higher title certainty and reduced legal and operational risk in property transactions.
Business and Vision
LexTerra follows a hybrid model: freemium access for citizens, premium offerings for NRIs and institutions, and SaaS APIs for governments and legal ecosystem partners. The long-term vision is to establish LexTerra as the global standard layer for property title security infrastructure, beginning with high-risk, high-growth markets and expanding to jurisdictions with structurally weak land title protection
